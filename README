This project i started several years ago mostly as a joke, but since the development of Web3 and crypto its gotten my inspired to try learning some new skills and test
a web3 Website hosted on a blockchain service. would be appropriate to host a crypto website entirely on a blockchain lol.

more to come! im still figuring all this out and am very new to programming at all. so Hold your prejudice dum dums.
